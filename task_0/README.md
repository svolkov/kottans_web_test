**1. Watch try.github.io.**

- Git command “git log” was new for me.
- Format of the commit number surprised me.
- “-u” attribute of “git commit” will be used by me very often I think.

**2. Read sixrevisions.com/web-development/git-tips/**
- The term Staging Area was new for me; Branching Concept became more clear.
- Message “Git is almost 100% foolproof’ surprised me because I was afraid of making mistake and losing data. 
- GIT GUIs will be helpful in daily use.

**3. Finish the course “How to use Git and Github”**
- Working with GitHub.com I've found some new operations: forking, merging of the remote repositories. 
- I surprised that collaborating with other people via GitHub.com is not very hard.
- At least I’ll use my repositories on the GitHub.com to get the last version of my working data in the PC in the office and in the laptop at home.

**4. Finish "learngitbranching" course and put the screenshots of completed tasks**
   The course has been finished successfully.
   Results can be found on the screenshot1 and screenshot2.
   It was really exciting course!
